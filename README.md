# Document-Converter-Script
A friend needed a large set of word documents converted to .txt files, so I created this script. It is still a work in progress. Current state allows .docx word documents be converted to .txt files in the of the directory that is added to the file. (Follow comments) This will be changed to save .txt to current working directory versus a hard coded directory. Also, looking into using kivy get an fairly easy application up and running for individuals that do not have experience with code/compiling code.
